## About understanding the universe from within the universe

We try to understand the nature of the universe without a sufficient understanding of the computational processes that it would take, if our minds are capable of doing so, or if not what kind of information processing system would be capable of it. **Does it take a universe to understand the universe? Or a universe-like thing?**
If there is enough reducibility in the universe, perhaps the complexity of the computer required to understand the universe need only be as complex as the configurations of its reducible parts.

From the perspective of an information processing system embedded in the system we are trying to understand (ie. humans in the universe), **how can we formalize their coupling so that we have a better understanding of our human-ness (limitations/potential/etc)?** Are our current best explanations of physical phenomena in the universe (ie. electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, etc) human-centric (ie. **would an alien brain invent the same physics**)? How many different consistent frameworks exist to explain newtonian mechanical systems, quantum systems, etc. What can we learn from **examining our modalities of explanation**
of physical systems (ie. dynamical laws and counterfactual explanations in physics)? What are all the ways of knowing? Is there a definable information theoretic 
**coupling between a question and an explanation?** If so, can it perhaps guide our discovery process? How can **engineering diverse sets of other communicative intelligent systems** help us see our human-ness?

If the closest knowing that can exist between coupled dynamical information processing systems is to be or contain an exact copy of the other then what information theoretic properties of the system we'd like to know or understand need to be reflected in the other? (ie. in what ways does the system trying to form a model of the other need to reflect the properties of the other?) **Can we develop a better information-theoretic framework for information-processing systems that can better guide how we engineer computers to aid our understanding of physical phenomena in the universe?** 

Neurons, for example, are a base unit in a computer that reconfigures to minimize surprise (ie our brains). They are always trying to create a minimal but accurate representation of whatever they are coupled with (ie via perceptors). Other nano/micro/macro base units can be engineered to exhibit similar behavior but **what information theoretic formalizations can guide the process of designing information processing systems?**

And of course, aliens....**What's wrong with the question: "Why haven't aliens contacted us?"** Maybe they have a better understanding of social models so they have procedures for when/how to intervene that are not based on their specific alien culture but rather an information theoretic/complex systems perspective that looks at the dynamics of the information processing systems at play rather than the specific species flavor of parameters. Maybe they've cracked the puzzle of what it means to be a computer within a universe trying to understand it and know what questions to ask and how informational couplings in computational systems work. For example, we make mistakes constantly about when/where/how to intervene in other countries in the same world with the same species that only differ in culture. How could we possibly understand something as different as an alien might be? Much less know what contact can/should look like or speculate about why they haven't contacted us. How can we formalize the landscapes of computers (meat computers or otherwise) that are helpful or not for resiliency, etc? Can we specify a framework for understanding different cultures without the details of the specific culture being a factor but rather its dynamics in the system as a whole?

(mappings_between_structures)=
## About mappings between structures in computational models

A computer (ie mind, human + pen/paper, etc) that understands a physical system has a model of that system. We might say its configuration or structure contains an informational mapping between it and the physical system. **What can we deduce from the configuration or structure of an information processing system?** For example, if a neural organoid system (ie a brain-like computer) is coupled to a physical system (ie for example, pong or something that simulates classical mechanics), then in its configuration or structure there exists an informational mapping (ie to dynamical laws of motion). 

How can we **reverse engineer an informational representation from a structural configuration** and translate it into an equivalent language like laws of motion, quantum mechanics, etc.? What can we learn from a reduced structural model in various computational systems in terms of rules/laws/states/transformations/configurations/etc that govern the physical system in question?

(relative_rates_of_processing)=
## About relative rates of processing in coupled computational systems

Relative to the processing speed of our brains, the rules that govern physical systems (ie. physics laws of the universe, etc) appear to be static. **Are the rules that govern physics constant through time or do they just appear constant given our brain's rate of processing and relative lifespans?** 

On the other hand, the rules that govern agentic systems in the universe (ie complex adaptive systems like social and economic systems) appear dynamic and so our rate of discovery must be updated to accommodate the pace of the changing rules to maintain a continual effective understanding of them. Computational systems coupled with these complex adaptive systems can be a useful tool for rule discovery that keeps pace with the dynamics of rules in the system of interest. **What can we learn about representational capacity relative to rates of configurability of coupled dynamical systems?**

For example, let's say we coupled a brain-like thing with a subset of physical systems so that it discovered the information theoretic (ie structural representations) of the rules that the systems follow like electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, etc. Once it learned the rules, its configuration would be relatively static because in our experiences of physical reality we don't see those rules changing, however in something like a social system the rules do change faster so if we couple a brain-like thing to this social system we will need to not only discover the rules at time t but another layer of abstraction about the rules about the rules.

(engineering_computers)=
## About engineering and reverse-engineering computers

As an engineer, when we have to design and/or build something there is always an implicit or explicit set of requirements (ie specs) that guide the design process. Yet, if we were to experiment with how to design an information processing system that could understand and model an economic system or some other complex adaptive system, or some physical system like quantum mechanical systems, there isn't a good framework to guide the design of a computer that could be best suited for modeling that system. 

For example, 
- How could we design the coupling interface between the human, computer and system of interest? 
- How can we configure/program/control the system and with what levels of granularity? 
- What state space of configurations and transformations needs to be possible? 
- How fast does reconfiguration need to be able to happen? 
- What resolution do perceptors need to have and over what state space and timeline of the system? 
- What parts of the computational process should be offloaded to which system? 
- With what efficiency does reconfiguration need to occur? 
- What does the efficiency/timeline of execution of a configuration need to be? 

Also, **How can we engineer nano/micro/macro-scale base units that reconfigure to **minimize surprise similar to neuronal** base units?**

(programming)=
## About programming

A major bottleneck in computation is the manual configuration of computers (ie humans explicitly programming computers). A while ago the predominate method of computation was that humans would model a question and algorithm in their head and then execute computations manually (abacus, pen/paper using math, etc) until we learned how to set an initial condition, an algorithm (or rules) and execute the 'compute' step automatically. 

Now, we are all habituated to manually setting up the initial condition and algorithm but that part of the computational process can (and in many cases should be) be offloaded from us. When we learn to effectively couple computational systems with the systems they are attempting to model/predict/understand the days of manual programming will be probably left in the dust like the abacus has been. **What does the landscape of possibilities for configuring information processing systems look like?** From manual configurations (ie conventional programming) at one extreme to our brains which auto-configure to minimize surprise at the other extreme and all of the various other configuration control systems that are possible.

Perhaps an exploration of programming in the context of complex adaptive systems can elucidate how non-explicit programming can work. For example, **Can complex systems frameworks help us answer questions about when taking action to avert a disaster is warranted and when letting things play out is ideal (socially, culturally, economically, etc)? What structural changes in systems warrant what kinds of responses?** For example, do the changes in society that will ensue from AI warrant guidance/programming or are the shakes and shutters best to let them play out to aid in overall system resilience? Like a simulated annealing concept.

Another example might be society's tendency to centralize and decentralize its structures based on environmental states. Rather than being stuck in decentralized or centralized governmental structures can it be dynamic? **Can we create a social structure with rules that are dynamic but tend towards a stable attractor that is more decentralized?** For example, can the system be so well designed/engineered so that in times of need top-down centralized control can rule but when fear and suffering subside the rules/system automagically tends toward a decentralized equilibrium again?

(universality)=
## About universality

**What do pervasive paradoxes in mathematics and other fields tell us about the nature of the universe? Do paradoxes help guide us to contextualized models (ie rule systems) of the universe? Do they hint at non-universality in computation? Is there a universal framework for understanding all physical phenomena?** Are special numbers in physics like settings in a universe controls system? Are they just the only settings that work to make life/consciousness work?

(encodings)=
## About encoding

We learn about various information encodings but like the fish in the water, it's all surrounded by our language. Our language doesn't only consist of procedures yet there is an information-theoretic coupling between my meat computer and yours when we communicate to share and understand ideas--that is, build internal models of the other. So **is there a deeper relationship between langauge, speakable procedures, computability and algorithms that we haven't wrapped our heads around?** 

What about things that have no strong linguistic encoding but are still part of our shared consensus reality? **How can the {term}`undefined understood` be examined from a computational and/or an information theory perspective? Does language have the capacity to be a perfect encoder? Is the absence of a linguistic encoding for a concept hinting at a specific structural feature of the pattern? Does the existence of the undefined understood contradict the notion of language as a perfect/complete encoder for information processes?**

(collective_conscious)=
## About collective conscious

**What can we accomplish together that we cannot accomplish as individuals or small groups?** What if people from around the world could work together as seamlessly as the part within my body and mind? How can we predict the points where more becomes different in complex systems and what the next stage of different (rules) will be?
