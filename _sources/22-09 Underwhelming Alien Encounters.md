>This is a collection of fictional (inspired by real events) short stories about alien encounters that are not the typical "first contact" stories. Instead, they explore the concept of engaging with alien minds that are highly unrecognizable in their physical form but their patterns and interactions reveal intelligence. These stories are about the scientists that learned how to see, understand them and eventually learn from them,

## A Natural History of Sapioliths

### Preface
The following ...


Evidence suggests that sapioliths are intelligent explorers. Though they are not the aliens that many of us expected or hoped for they undoutebly meet all definitions of general intelligence that we have thus far conceived. They reproduce, communicate, form adaptive models of their environment, and navigate it with purpose.

### Discovery
Savant space rocks were discovered by the XX in XX and have been studied extensively since then. Their lifecycle, though much longer than our own is deducible thanks to our understanding of ...

Models of the movement of asteroids in the asteroid belt improved throughout the 21st century allowing spacecraft to easily navigate without sustaining significant damage. Some anomolies however in the movement of the rocks continued to be unaccounted for. Most scientists chalked this up to inevitable model error that comes from the additive effects of small initial conditions in the time evolving system. 

Much later, as smaller spacecraft became more frequent improving our predictions of their trajectories beacme more essential. A closer analysis of the anomolies revealed patterns...Very slowly over time the rocks would cluster or disperse.

The samples that were eventually returned to Earth were embewed with complex networks of hardened veins, similar to the XX veins found in XX rocks. Unlike the veins that form from in XX rocks from the XX of XX over time XXX. These were networked like tree roots in soil. 

A frenzy of scientists studied the rocks followed by a SSR winter

Prior to this there is a documented case of a rock flying by Earth with an unusual trajectory observed by ... humans speculated its origin was alien o spaceship but it was unsubstantiated as the rock left as quickly as it came. (todo add details about that rock)

### Intelligence - Domains of Competency
The most useful definition of intelligence that has been applied to the study of sapioliths is "competency navigating spaces". They 

They modulate their energy stores
they have the ability to go dormant for very long periods of time

They form models of their environment and communicate
they share discoveries from their travels (models of the universe) with each other to be better prepared for navigating space without tumbling into a star or black hole

They are goal-oriented (when they arrive in certain environments...they seed?)
