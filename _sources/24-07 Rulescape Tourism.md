## The Mathematical World of Topological Spaces

Rex and Butler go for a walk about the lake


Rules:
infinitely stretchable, with no boundaries or limitations imposed within the context of the sheet itself.

Navigation
- based on homotopy (vs precise paths)
Concepts that make sense:
- 
Concepts that don't make sense:
- shortest path

Imagine a circular path around a tree in a park. If there's another path that also circles around the tree but perhaps is wider or narrower, both paths can be considered homotopic because one can be continuously deformed into the other without cutting through the tree (the obstacle).

In a world navigated via homotopy, agents wouldn't look for the shortest or most direct path; instead, they would find a path that's topologically equivalent to others they know, based on the ability to deform paths into one another.

In a cluttered room, an agent would see all paths that navigate through the room without moving obstacles as homotopic. The agent might choose any path that fits these criteria, seeing them as fundamentally the same, even if they wind differently between furniture.

Navigating around Obstacles: If navigating around a lake, the exact route taken doesn’t matter as much as the fact that all routes share the characteristic of encompassing the lake. All such routes would be equivalent.

Using Landmarks: In a topologically navigated world, landmarks aren’t just physical points but also features like holes, twists, or significant changes in the topology. For example, agents would recognize and navigate towards or around a spiraling ramp because it represents a unique topological feature in a building.

Environmental Constraints: In a cluttered room, an agent would see all paths that navigate through the room without moving obstacles as homotopic. The agent might choose any path that fits these criteria, seeing them as fundamentally the same, even if they wind differently between furniture.

Navigating the World

    Homotopy and Paths: Navigation would be based on the concept of homotopy rather than precise paths. Homotopy in topology involves understanding how one path can continuously deform into another without leaving a defined area. Agents would consider all paths that can be morphed into each other as equivalent. So, rather than finding the shortest path, they would find a path that can morphologically fit the environment's constraints.

    Using Landmarks as Invariant Features: Instead of using fixed points, agents might use invariant features such as holes, boundaries, or notable topological markers (like the presence of a twist or a junction of surfaces) to orient themselves and navigate through spaces.

Finding Each Other

    Communication via Connectedness: Without fixed locations, agents would rely heavily on the property of connectedness. They might use signals that can permeate the connected space, understanding that any signal that can traverse from one point to another signifies a path of connectedness. This could involve setting up a kind of 'topological beacon' that emits a detectable, continuous signal throughout a connected component.

    Encounters Through Common Features: Agents might frequently encounter each other at unique topological features that act as natural gathering spots—similar to how water flows together at a basin.

Interacting and Coordinating

    Shared Transformations: Interaction could be facilitated through shared actions or transformations of the space. For example, agents might coordinate to twist or stretch a region of space to achieve a collective goal or communicate through changes they effect in the topology of their environment.

    Understanding Through Structure: By modifying their environment’s structure, agents can send messages or create systems of signs. For instance, creating a loop or removing a twist could have specific meanings or instructions encoded in the topology.

Challenges and Solutions

    Lack of Rigidity: The absence of rigidity would mean that agents can't rely on unchanging spatial relationships. Instead, they might develop a keen sensitivity to the dynamic qualities of space, such as the resilience of certain shapes or the responsiveness of the environment to certain kinds of deformations.

    Navigational Uncertainty: Precise location-based navigation would be replaced by more probabilistic or relational navigation methods, where the path or the destination is defined in terms of relationships and transformations rather than coordinates.
