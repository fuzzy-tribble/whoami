# Research

At the core of my research is a desire to understand the nature of **diverse cognitive experiences** and contribute to building systems that integrate vastly different cultures, languages, forms of perception, and anatomical body plans. I believe that a complete understanding of our embodied minds will require communication with different forms of mind (discovered and/or engineered).

All of my work, including my research is deeply motivated by my own atypical sensory, perceptual, regulatory and action profile, which developed following a neurotoxic reaction in my twenties. These differences make me sensitive to the world in unique ways and fundamentally shape how I think, work, and design.
