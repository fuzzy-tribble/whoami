# Research

At the core of my research is a desire to understand the nature of **diverse cognitive experiences** and contribute to building systems that integrate vastly different cultures, languages, forms of perception, and anatomical body plans. I believe that a complete understanding of our embodied minds will require communication with different forms of mind (discovered and/or engineered).

>My research has a deeply personal foundation. In my twenties, I had a neurotoxic reaction that resulted in atypical sensory, perceptual, regulatory and action modalities which has become a central muse of my work.
