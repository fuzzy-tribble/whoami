# Research

**At the core of my research is a desire to understand myself in the context of the universe.**

This requires understanding the models of the universe that a mind invents (like physics, math, etc.) and the nature of the embodied mind itself. I call this mystery, the Diverse Intelligence Puzzle ({term}`DIP`).

The {term}`DIP` is about how we identify, understand, interact with and engineer all possible constructions of intelligence.

Though philosophers have long contemplated theory of mind, I believe that a complete understanding of our embodied minds will require communication with different forms of mind (discovered and/or engineered).

Therefore, my work is a combination of developing tools that help us identify, understand and interact with all universally possible constructs of intelligence as well as engineering/reverse-engineering specific instances of intelligence.
