# Background and Experience

I have a BS in Mechanical Eng (CS & IT minors) and worked as a SWE and founder in the Bay Area and abroad. Now I am diverting some attention to pursue my research interests (and grad school).

My years of working as an engineer (software and hardware/mechanical) have given me a wide range of skills that change based on what language, tools, MVPs, projects, etc I am actively working on. In general, I've built a lot of things that solve a lot of problems in various fields (like designing/developing/building UAVs, apps, dev ops systems, network security systems, complex data visualizations, hacking tools, distributed microserver networks, various AI hardware/software, parametric CAD, etc.).

Oh...and I've solved hundreds if not thousands of math, physics and engineering problems in my lifetime...in case that is a useful skill to anyone ðŸ˜‰
