# Background and Experience

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering (CS & IT minors) and worked as a SWE and founder in the Bay Area and abroad. Currently I am pursuing my [research interests](Research.md).

As an engineer (software + hardware) working in the startup industry I've developed a wide range of skills that adapt based on what the language, tools and projects require. In general, I've built a lot of things that solve a lot of problems in various fields (eg. designing/developing/building UAVs, apps, dev ops systems, network security systems, complex data visualizations, hacking tools, distributed microserver networks, various AI hardware/software, parametric CAD, etc....see my CV for details).
