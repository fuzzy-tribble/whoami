# Research Interests

The scientist in me explores what lies at the information theoretic intersections of mathematics, physics and computer science which includes cross-disciplinary work in fields like neuroscience, deep learning, quantum systems, category theory, complex systems and {term}`unconventional computing`. The engineer in me designs and builds systems that help us solve problems across domains and widen our perspectives and problem solving elegance.

I believe that a better understanding of informational processes (ie {term}`computation`) is useful and probably essential to our understanding of the universe and ourselves. 

Therefore, my path treads outside the conventional notions of computation or computer science. I explore informational states and their transformations and configurations, their representational capacity and engineering principles. I model computation not strictly as a Turing machine with a language and discrete elements but as a coupling between two or more dynamical information processing systems. I search for the information theoretic underpinnings that are the dance between coupled computational systems.

If you are new to the unconventional computing space, this paper provides an introduction to [_the whole computational universe_](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/9789811235726_0001).
