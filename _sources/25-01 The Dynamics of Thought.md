Idea: write a post that describes the dynamics of something and you have to ID what it is/has.





Imagine an idea that:
- Flashes by like a passing car, then fades.  
- Returns persistently, replaying its own storyline.  
- Mutates into something new each time it reemerges.

That’s the **dynamics of a thought**—a continuous flow that we then slice into discrete “concepts” with our languages.
