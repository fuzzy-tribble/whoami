“A lot of science and a lot of philosophy is about being in a community of nurturing scholars and being willing to learn from them and feeling supported – feeling that what you’re doing matters. I mean, I’ve always been interested in consciousness, but it took a community to give me the confidence that I might have something worth saying or there were people to collaborate with. I think that’s an important part of my story is feeling part of a community.”

"On an ordinary day, on the streets of Szeged, as I walked home from a clinic feeling horribly ill I had a flash of insight. No one would ever miss the contribution I didn't make. No one would knock on my door and beg me to continue working. If I stopped or if I pulled back my efforts one bit at a time until I was giving less than my full potentional the loss would go entirely unnoticed. A world that is missing an important contribution looks ordinary. It is the definition of the status quo."

-- Katalin Karikó
