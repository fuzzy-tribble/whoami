*The "whole computational universe" perspective of computation isn't restricted to silicone digital computers like the one I'm working on right now. But lets not define it by what its not...what is the whole computational universe?*

A map of the whole computational universe should include any physical system that is also an information processing system (meaning ones whose process or transformation can be represented in other information media. 

This includes computers that require *manual mechanical execution* like an abacus, slide rule or engineering compass. Ones that follow rules like logical calculus and other *axiomatic mathematical constructions*. It includes flow diagrams and other *graphical computations*. It includes those *electro-mechanical* ones with lightning-fast executions like calculators, phones and laptops. Of course, it also includes *analog and bio-electric* computational systems like those that govern the transformation of an embryo into a human (morphogenesis). Or slime mold to solve search problems or our brains (individual and collective) to create state predictions about the complex world around us. The proteins whose embodied transformational capacity of matter compute homeostasis and other things. It also includes nano-scale physical processes like *quantum computers*.

The "whole computational universe" perspective of computation is like that of physics or mathematics--an effort to understand the whole universe. But in the case of math we choose a set of axiomatic rules and follow them to discover things. In the case of physics we observe physical systems and try to find the rules (usually math ones but sometimes counterfactual or others) that best model the system. In the case of computer science, we observe distinguishable but coupled physical systems and examine the dynamics of their coupled state space and rule space.

So an effective map of the whole computational universe is a map of the information theoretic processes of the universe (state spaces and rule spaces in coupled dynamical systems). Given any physical system, we can examine its state space (all possible distinguishable configurations) and rule space (rules that transformations between configurations follow).

**A noteworthy aside:** There is an important piece of the computational puzzle we have been neglecting. Computational processes are not about a single physical system's states and rules. Informational processes are only informational if there is another system that can perceive and distinguish a state change in another. Who cares? Shouldn't we be thinking about computational processes in the context of humans using the computer? Maybe, but perhaps formalizing what it means for two coupled dynamical systems to share information will help us understand our human-ness among all of the other computational systems in the universe. Maybe it will help us understand what "aliens" could be like and how they understand the universe.  So yes, computation is the process that occurs between at least two information processing systems. Specifically, it's the process of at least two distinguishable systems with at least two possible configurations that can be configured by the state of the other.

(For example, put a human, an octopus and a light in a matte black room. Turn the light on or off alternating between polarized and non-polarized light. The human can distinguish 2 states (on/off) while the octopus distinguishes 3 states (on-polarized, off, on-non-polarized). Therefore, the state space possible between the coupling of the two information systems (human and light) is different. So an octopus might build a different kind of computer)


## What's an examination of state space and rule space look like?

In an examination of state space, we look at the possible configurations of the physical systems (that are distinguishable to us)--that is its states. We usually like our tools (computational and otherwise) to be reliable, efficient and relatively fast so we can use them again and again. We also usually like them to be easily reconfigurable so that we can use them for different purposes and problems.

For example, let's look at state space and rule space for some physical systems

- Macro-scale physical systems at term STP like billiard balls, flow systems, sticks, etc tend to have a state space that is some subset of Euclidean space and follow rules that are described by classical mechanics. We can expect the computers engineered using these systems to be precise and reliable but probably not particularly efficient or fast. They can probably be engineered to have some degree of reconfigurability but at the expense of time and energy.

- Micro-scale physical systems like cells, transistors in your computer, etc...

- Nano-scale physical systems, like carbon nano-tubes, atoms, electrons, photons, quantum dots ...quantum mechanical rules


## Reversible: A computation is reversible if it is always possible to uniquely recover the input, given the output. For example, the NOT operation is reversible, because if the output bit is 0, you know the input bit must have been 1, and vice versa. On the other hand, the AND operation is not reversible.


How reliable is state transformation? Some computational processes are inherently reliable like radioactive decay and others are reliable because they have error-correcting mechanisms like how DNA polymerases proofread copied strands and others like how a soap bubble transforms light aren't reliable at all.

What is the time and energy cost of transformations? What is the time and energy cost of configuration? The efficiency of executing logical AND gate in your computer is constant. Configuring a bunch of gates may be constant depending on whether you include human programming as part of the configuration process.

Can the system be configured to perform different transformations? For example, modern digital computers made of logical circuits are highly configurable/programmable but configuring the physical space (ie a maze) around slime mold to solve a search problem is arduous. What is the complete state space of transformations of the physical system? This gets into the rules (ie physics) that govern the system in question like physics allows reversibility in transformations at some scales (ie quantum mechanics) but not in others.

# Mapping the Computational Universe
**If silicone digital computers like the one I'm working on right now are not representative of the whole computational universe then what is in the whole computational universe?**

The "whole computational universe" perspective of computation is like that of physics or mathematics--an effort to understand the whole universe (in our case doing so in terms of information theory). 

So an effective map of the whole computational universe is essentially a map of the information theoretic processes of the universe.
